                        technology. We have a long history with Odoo. We are working on Odoo since it was called TinyERP
                        or OpenERP. We worked on several Odoo versions starting from Odoo v5. So we saw the growth of
                        Odoo from bottom to up. Our expertise with Odoo helps us serve a wide range of Odoo services
                        under a single roof.
