                        We are a bunch of geeks who love to solve problems with the help of new technology. We have a
                        long history with Odoo. We are working on Odoo since it was called TinyERP or OpenERP. We worked
                        on several Odoo versions starting from Odoo v5. So we saw the growth of Odoo from bottom to up.
                        Our expertise with Odoo helps us serve a wide range of Odoo services under a single roof.
